  Research in the Language and Computation Lab 
  investigates how the human brain solves the 
  computational problems of language comprehension, 
  production, and acquisition. We use techniques 
  from machine learning, computational linguistics, 
  and statistics to build computational models of 
  such language behaviors. We test these models 
  by analyzing large behavioral and neuroscientific 
  datasets, and also by gathering new empirical data, 
  especially via eye tracking and crowdsourcing.
