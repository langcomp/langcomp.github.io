    As an individual reads, visual information is being collected each word's identity from the letters on the page.
    Current models of (visual) letter recognition account for either letter order effects or perceptual similarity
    effects. Here, we aim to model human visual letter recognition by incorporating known neuro-biological shape/form
    response profiles of the primary visual cortex. Gabor-based wavelet convolution, a computer vision technique,
    successfully performs object recognition and is a candidate for capturing human-like letter order and perceptual
    similarity effects. This technique extracts higher-level features of an image using kernels with response patterns
    mimicking simple cells of the primary visual cortex.

    The difficulty associated with processing an accented speech signal
    diminishes within the first minutes of an encounter (Bradlow & Bent, 2008).
    Despite the many challenges posed by speech perception and accent adaptation,
    and the ease with which humans accomplish such tasks, there exist few cognitive
    models of adaptation. This project investigates the question of what type of
    phonetic information facilitates adaptation to foreign-accented speech.
    In this work, the task of accent adaptation is represented as a problem of
    Bayesian inference, in which speakers use prior knowledge—about speakers,
    specific accents, and foreign accented speech more generally—to make predictions
    about novel talkers, thus aiding in more rapid adaptation. This process of generalization
    can be represented hierarchically and allows for generalizations at multiple levels
    (e.g., word, segment, etc.). The goal of this work is to investigate and identify what
     sort of learning takes place during accent adaptation. Further, this project seeks
     to leverage the processes that underlie language comprehension to identify phonological
     information that facilitates adaptation to foreign accented speech.
