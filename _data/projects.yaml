  The difficulty associated with processing an accented speech signal 
  diminishes within the first minutes of an encounter (Bradlow & Bent, 2008). 
  Despite the many challenges posed by speech perception and accent adaptation, 
  and the ease with which humans accomplish such tasks, there exist few cognitive models of adaptation. 
  This project investigates the question of what type of phonetic information facilitates adaptation to 
  foreign-accented speech. In this work, the task of accent adaptation is represented as a problem of 
  Bayesian inference, in which speakers use prior knowledge—about speakers, specific accents, 
  and foreign accented speech more generally—to make predictions about novel talkers, thus aiding in 
  more rapid adaptation. This process of generalization can be represented hierarchically and allows for
  generalizations at multiple levels (e.g., word, segment, etc.). The goal of this work is to 
  investigate and identify what sort of learning takes place during accent adaptation. Further, this 
  project seeks to leverage the processes that underlie language comprehension to identify phonological 
  information that facilitates adaptation to foreign accented speech.
