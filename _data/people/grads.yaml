    Nicole is currently in her second year as a PhD student in the Northwestern Department of Linguistics. Her interests include investigating how we construct and infer phonological grammatical knowledge from the language around us, as well as how this knowledge interacts with online memory, eventually leading to an understanding of how the mind represents phonology. In her spare time, she enjoys getting lost.
