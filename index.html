<div class="gigantic">Language and Computation Lab</div>
<p> Research in the Language and Computation Lab investigates how the human brain solves the computational problems of language comprehension, production, and acquisition. We use techniques from machine learning, computational linguistics, and statistics to build computational models of such language behaviors. We test these models by analyzing large behavioral and neuroscientific datasets, and also by gathering new empirical data, especially via eye tracking and crowdsourcing. </p>
